# ONT test datasets 

Both the DNA and RNA datasets are for MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. 

For the test data both datasets have been filtered for chr20 to make it an appropriate size for analysis.

# DNA
The DNA data is sequenced using a targeted cas9 approach. 
This data came in the format of fast5's (raw data from an ONT sequencer). 
Therefore, it was rebasecalled with guppy (v6.4.6) and the sup (super high accuracy) R9.4.1 E8.2 model. 

Basecalling command used:
/path/to/ont-guppy6.4.6/bin/guppy_basecaller \
    -x cuda:0 \
    -r \
    -i /path/to/TG_04_Mcf7_brPanel_MinION_fast5 \
    -s /path/to/output/folder \
    -c /path/to/model/ont-guppy6.4.6/data/dna_r9.4.1_e8.1_sup.cfg

# RNA 

The RNA data comes from the Singapore Nanopore-Expression Project which looks at 5 cancer cell lines.

Github: https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data
Data: https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data/blob/master/docs/AWS_data_access_tutorial.md
Using this cDNA run: SGNex_MCF7_cDNA_replicate1_run3/
Note: There is also dRNA data here which could be tried (plus replicates of both types)
SGNex_MCF7_directRNA_replicate1_run1/

The available data can be checked using this command:
aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://sg-nex-data/data/sequencing_data_ont/bam/genome/
